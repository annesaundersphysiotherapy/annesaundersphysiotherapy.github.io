<h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
<p><em>Why we collect your personal data and what we do with it.</em></p>

<p>When you supply your personal data to the clinic they are stored and used in accordance with the <b>Data Protection Act 2018</b> and <b>GDPR</b>.</p>

<p>The reasons we need to collect personal information are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To provide you with the best possible treatment. Your requesting treatment and our agreement to provide that care constitutes a <b>contract</b>. You can of course refuse to provide that information, but if you were to do that we would not be able to provide treatment.</li>
  <li>We have a <b>legitimate interest</b> in collecting that information as without that we would not be able to do our job effectively and safely.</li>
  <li>We also think it is important that we are able to contact you when needed to confirm appointments or update you on any matters related to your medical care.</li>
</ol>

<p>Clinical notes and data are stored electronically with Nookal practice management software. <a href="https://www.nookal.com/uk/legal/gdpr" target="_blank">Read more about Nookal's GDPR compliance</a>. By law we have to keep these records for 8 years (or until a patient is 25 years of age). After this period you can ask us to destroy your records if you wish. Otherwise we will retain your records indefinitely in order that we provide you with the best possible care should you need to see us at future dates.</p>

<p>Any data sent externally such as letters to GP / Consultants will only be sent with your permission either via secure email by computers with appropriate security packages or postage. Consent to send this information will be obtained by the patient prior to sending. No medical data will be stored on the computer however we may email you with permission information relating to your treatment. This will be done by computers with appropriate security packages installed.</p>

<p>We will never share your data with anyone who does not need access without your written consent. Only the following people will have routine access to your data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your practitioner(s) in order that they can provide you with treatment</li>
  <li>Our reception staff as they organise practitioners diaries and appointments but they do not have access to your medical records.</li>
</ul>

<p>You have the right to see what personal data of yours we hold and you can ask us to correct any factual errors.</p> 

<p>We want you to be absolutely confident that we are treating your personal data responsibly and that we are doing everything we can to make sure that only people who can access your data have a genuine need to do so.</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the handling of your personal data you have the right to raise the matter with the Information Commissioners Office.</p>
