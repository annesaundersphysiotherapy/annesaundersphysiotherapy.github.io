          <blockquote>
            <p>I've not had much experience of physiotherapy professionals but I'm really glad I found Anne. She is very thorough in finding out what is wrong and explains in detail the treatment she is giving. This is supplemented with exercise information that she provides by email with very useful video clips. Anne has a very caring and warm hearted personality and I am always confident that she will sort me out.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>I have attended pilates class run by Anne for over 6 months. I suffer from severe lymphodema in both legs and am not able to do certain exercises to the same extent as other people. Unlike other classes I have attended Anne ensures that the exercises are set to different ranges of difficulty so that everyone in our class is able to participate. She is knowledgable, professional and personable and I would highly recommend her classes.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>I had been suffering with back and leg pain for several months and it was starting to affect my work and exercise routine. I attended a short course of physiotherapy with Anne and within a very short period of time my pain had resolved and I was able to get back to exercising as I had done previously. Anne discussed my problem with me in detail and advised me about my sitting position whilst driving and gave me home exercises to do which I still continue to do to stop the problem from recurring. Anne was thorough and professional and I would certainly pay her a visit again if I had any further problems.</p>
